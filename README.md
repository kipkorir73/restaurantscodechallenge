## RESTAURANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This project is a Restaurant Review Management System that allows you to manage restaurants, customers, and their reviews. It is built using SQLAlchemy, a powerful Python ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library. With this system, you can perform various operations related to restaurant reviews, such as adding, editing, and deleting reviews, finding the favorite restaurant of a customer, and more.
## Features


Restaurant Management: Create and manage restaurant records, including their names and price levels.

Customer Management: Create and manage customer records, including first names and last names.

Review Management: Create and manage reviews, associating them with both customers and restaurants. Reviews include star ratings and comments.

Relationships: Establishes relationships between restaurants, customers, and reviews. A restaurant has many reviews, a customer has many reviews, and a review belongs to both a restaurant and a customer.

Aggregates: Calculate aggregates such as the favorite restaurant of a customer and the fanciest restaurant based on price.
